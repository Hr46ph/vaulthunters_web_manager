Authentication Implementation Status

## ⚠️ **IMPLEMENTATION UPDATE**: PAM Abandoned for Security Reasons

**Original Plan**: Linux PAM integration with system accounts  
**Actual Implementation**: Simple file-based authentication  
**Reason**: PAM requires elevated privileges and creates security risks

---

## Current Implementation (File-Based Authentication)

**Active System**:
```python
# Simple JSON-based user authentication
from services.auth_manager import AuthManager

# Authenticate against local database
result = AuthManager.authenticate_user(username, password)

# Users stored in data/users.json with:
# - Salted password hashes (SHA-256)
# - User roles (admin/user) 
# - Active/inactive status
```

**Benefits**:
- No system privileges required
- Web-specific passwords (isolated from system)
- Easy user management via AuthManager methods
- No PAM configuration complexity
- Secure password hashing with salt

**Default Users**:
- `admin:admin123` (admin role)
- `ingemar:minecraft123` (admin role)

---

## Original PAM Design (Abandoned)

Core Implementation:
# Using python-pam for Linux account validation
import pam
import pyotp

def authenticate_user(username, password, totp_token=None):
    # First: Validate against Linux accounts
    if not pam.authenticate(username, password):
        return False

    # Second: Validate 2FA if enabled
    if totp_token:
        return validate_totp(username, totp_token)
    return True

Benefits:
- Leverages existing user accounts (adduser minecraft-admin)
- Respects Linux password policies and expiration
- No duplicate credential management
- Works with existing SSH key users

sudo Group Integration

Enhanced Security:
# Check if user is in authorized groups
import grp

def user_authorized(username):
    try:
        # Check if user is in sudo or custom minecraft-admins group
        sudo_group = grp.getgrnam('sudo')
        return username in sudo_group.gr_mem
    except KeyError:
        return False

2FA Implementation Options

TOTP (Google Authenticator/Authy):
- Store TOTP secrets in /home/minecraft/.vhwm-secrets/
- QR code generation for initial setup
- Backup codes for recovery

Hardware Keys (Advanced):
- WebAuthn/FIDO2 support
- YubiKey integration
- Fallback to TOTP

Configuration Extension

[authentication]
enabled = true
method = "pam"  # Use Linux accounts
require_2fa = true
allowed_groups = ["sudo", "minecraft-admins"]
totp_issuer = "VaultHunters Manager"
backup_codes_count = 10

This approach provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining simplicity - users manage one password (Linux
account) plus 2FA, and administrators use familiar adduser/usermod commands for access control.

### Phase 4: Security Hardening & Polish (Updated for File-Based Auth)
**Goal**: Add security features and improve user experience

**Updated Tasks**:
1. Implement session timeout and renewal
2. Add rate limiting for login attempts
3. Create audit logging for authentication events
4. Add "Remember Me" functionality with secure tokens
5. ~~Implement password change integration with Linux accounts~~ ✅ **Web-based password change functionality** (completed in Phase 2)
6. Add security headers and CSRF protection enhancement

9. ~~**New**: Add password strength requirements~~ ✅ **Basic password strength requirements** (8+ chars, completed in Phase 2)

**Deliverables**:
- Session security improvements
- Brute force protection
- Audit trail
- Production-ready security features

### Phase 5A: Basic TLS/HTTPS Implementation ✅ **COMPLETED (Integrated Caddy + User-Space Certificates)**
**Goal**: ~~Enable HTTPS with self-signed certificates~~ **Implement production-ready HTTPS with integrated Caddy reverse proxy and user-space certificate management**

**Original Tasks (Flask SSL - Performance Issues)**:
1. ~~Generate self-signed SSL certificates for development/testing~~ ✅ **Completed but deprecated**
2. ~~Configure Flask app to support HTTPS with SSL context~~ ✅ **Completed but too slow**
3. ~~Update configuration options for SSL certificate paths~~ ✅ **Completed but replaced**
4. ~~Implement HTTP to HTTPS redirect middleware~~ ✅ **Completed but replaced**

**Final Implementation (Integrated Caddy with User-Space Certificates)**:
1. ✅ **Integrated Flask + Caddy lifecycle management** (Flask automatically starts/stops Caddy)
2. ✅ **User-space certificate management** (no sudo privileges required)
3. ✅ **Flask HTTP backend** on 127.0.0.1:8081 (fast, no SSL overhead)
4. ✅ **Caddy HTTPS frontend** on 0.0.0.0:8889 (external access)
5. ✅ **Self-signed certificates in user space** (~/.local/share/caddy)
6. ✅ **Security compliance** (no elevated privileges needed)

**Critical Security Resolution**:
- **Problem**: Caddy `tls internal` attempted automatic certificate installation requiring `sudo`
- **Solution**: Added `skip_install_trust` and user-space storage configuration
- **Result**: Zero sudo requirements, certificates stored in `~/.local/share/caddy`

**Updated Caddy Configuration**:
```caddyfile
# Global options - user-space certificate management
{
    auto_https off  # Disable automatic HTTPS redirects (no port 80 access)
    admin localhost:2019  # Non-privileged admin port
    skip_install_trust    # No system certificate installation
    storage file_system {
        root {$HOME}/.local/share/caddy
    }
}

:8889 {
    bind 0.0.0.0  # Accept external connections
    reverse_proxy 127.0.0.1:8081  # Proxy to Flask backend
    tls internal {
        on_demand  # Generate certificates as needed
    }
    # Security headers, compression, logging...
}
```

**Updated Flask Configuration**:
```toml
[web]
host = "127.0.0.1"  # Localhost only (backend for Caddy)
port = 8081
ssl_enabled = false  # Caddy handles all SSL
```

**Flask Integration Features**:
- ✅ **Automatic Caddy startup/shutdown** in Flask `main()` function
- ✅ **Graceful signal handling** (SIGTERM/SIGINT cleanup)
- ✅ **Process verification** with socket connectivity tests
- ✅ **Error handling** with detailed startup diagnostics
- ✅ **Logging integration** (Caddy logs to `logs/caddy_access.log`)

**Security Benefits**:
- **No elevated privileges**: Entire stack runs as limited `natie` user
- **User-space certificates**: All certificates in `~/.local/share/caddy`
- **Let's Encrypt ready**: Future domain certificates require no sudo
- **Process isolation**: Web vulnerabilities cannot escalate to system access

**Performance Benefits**:
- **TLSv1.3 support**: Modern encryption protocols
- **HTTP/2 and HTTP/3**: Optimized connection handling
- **No Flask SSL overhead**: Pure HTTP backend with TLS termination
- **Gzip compression**: Automatic response compression

**Deliverables**:
- ✅ **Integrated application lifecycle** (single systemd service manages both)
- ✅ **User-space HTTPS** with self-signed certificates
- ✅ **External accessibility** via https://server-ip:8889
- ✅ **Security compliance** (no sudo required)
- ✅ **Let's Encrypt compatibility** for future domain deployments
- ✅ **Professional certificate warnings** (expected for self-signed certs)

### Phase 5B: Advanced Certificate Management
**Goal**: Add comprehensive certificate management features

**Tasks**:
1. Add certificate management utilities (generation, renewal)
2. Add SSL certificate validation and error handling
3. Create documentation for certificate setup and management

**Deliverables**:
- Certificate management interface
- SSL certificate validation and error handling
- SSL configuration documentation

**Dependencies**:
- Phase 1 must complete before Phase 2
- Phase 2 must complete before Phase 3
- Phases 3-4 can be implemented independently after Phase 2
- Phase 5A (Basic TLS) can be implemented independently after Phase 1
- Phase 5B (Advanced Certificate Management) can be implemented independently after Phase 5A
- Phase 6 can be implemented independently after Phase 2
